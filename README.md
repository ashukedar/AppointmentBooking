# AppointmentBooking

This repository is a part of final project for the ADBMS Practical lab for 2nd semester of the Data Analytics course from IIT ISM Dhanbad

The code in this repository is a software system used for booking appointments where patients can register themselves in the portal and hence get the appointment slot for the doctor of their related disease.
It consists of the following Modules:
1. Admin Services
2. Doctor Services
3. Patient Services

It demostrates the use of basic database features like Views, Roles, Trigger and Queries for creating software solution for the given problem
Additionally, we also predict the salary of the doctor using linear regression machine learning technique using features like Fees charged, specialization, avg patient appointment count, etc
